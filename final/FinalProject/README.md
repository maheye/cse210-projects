Open-ended project plan.

Project Description:

As part of my project, I plan to develop a console logging game called Hangman. This is a traditional guessing game that can be played by two or more players. One player thinks of a word, and the other players guess the word by guessing one letter at a time. Words are represented by horizontal lines, with each line representing a letter. The player needs to correctly guess all the letters to win.

Each time you guess the wrong letter, the game will draw a part of the "hangman". It's usually showing gallows and a small man. If the entire "hangman" is drawn and the player fails to guess the word correctly, they lose the game. There are usually six guesses.    

Players will be pitted against computers and random word generators. The computer generates a random word from the list provided. The player has 6 chances to guess the word, otherwise the computer wins. Each wrong guess will draw a portion of the "hangman".

The score will be used as the overall score for the game. I plan to assign points to each letter based on the value of the letters in the Scrabble game. The game is both a casual game and a great way to teach vocabulary and spelling.
